# MinHeap Implementation

## Author
**Clara Watson**

## Description: 
The program min_heap.py uses dynamic_array.py to implement the complete binary tree heap in which the value in each internal node is smaller than or equal to the values in the children of that node.

## Background
A heap data structure is typically a complete binary tree, in which every node's value is less than or equal to the values of its children. This version of the heap is specifically called a minimum binary heap, or just “min heap”. We can also have a “max heap”, where each node’s value is greater than or equal to the values of its children.
